*Markets update (27 Jan - 2 Feb 2026)* #liquid #macro

*TL;DR*
Nothing much to update as we're back to market chop zone. Update: chop has turned into breakdown.

*1) 27 Jan Update*
Last week's cautious stance remains valid as BTC is testing the critical $87k support level - a genuine inflection point for near-term market structure.
- ETH has failed to hold $3k and is trading around $2.9k, reinforcing the broader altcoin weakness previously flagged.
- ETHBTC has deteriorated further to <0.0332, matching Nov-Dec lows that marked the prior cycle bottom. Any further weakness and we might see new lows.
- SOL is actually outperforming on a relative basis, holding $120 level pretty well, which could mean SOL > ETH in terms of altcoin selection.
- FOMC (28-29 Jan) and Dec PCE (31 Jan) are immediate macro risks; any hawkish surprise at current fragile levels would probably mean weakness for the rest of Q1.

*2) 2 Feb Update - Bear Market Confirmed*
As shared above in my last market note, if there were to be:
- Hawkishness from FOMC (i.e. no indication of rate cuts)
- If we were to break new lows beyond the Q4 wicks
- If there were to be increasing macro unrest (US sending troops to Iran + increasing ICE attacks)

It would mean we're not just back to that ugly Q4 chop but headed for bear market.

*Current prices:*
BTC @ $75k
ETH @ $2.1k
SOL @ $97
ETHBTC @ 0.028

I've largely stabled up - time to preserve capital.

*Charts are all broken:*
- BTC next level is ~$70k
- ETH ~$1.8k
- SOL ~$78
