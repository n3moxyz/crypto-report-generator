Markets update (15 Jan 2026) #liquid #macro

1) Where we left off
The core message in the early-Jan update was:
> The market was showing genuine improvement in structure, but we are not yet in a confirmed "risk-on, deploy aggressively" regime.

At that point:
• BTC defended ~$87k and ETH was holding ~$3k.
• Too many prior rallies since Oct had failed for us to chase.

2) Current state of markets
• BTC reclaimed and broke $97k last night, strength here is very noticeable.
• ETH participation much better than last week — not lagging, which supports the narrative that this isn't just a BTC-only bounce.

Good signs
• Significant strength from majors and slowly flowing into alts
• Crypto pushing ahead while equities, commods stayed flat / down this week
• First CPI of the year (released earlier this week) was higher than 2% inflation target but markets didn't nuke (but print was lower than expectations - which is good)

Caveats
• Prices still rangebound (no clear bull market signal like if $100k holds), but much higher than before
• Central bank policies and rate cuts remain debated
• Economy is bad as GDP, jobs market deteriorating

3) Where I Lean
Lean: Constructive improvement — transition phase
Not yet full "risk-on, deploy aggressively," but clearly beyond fragile bounce.
